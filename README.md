## Note

I create this project as a digital notebook. It's not intended to be forked, cloned or deployed as a template for general usage, but for my own use. You can take whatever you find interesting and use it in your own website. I do provide a set of documentations but they're like my notes in case I need to come back to some features that I haven't touch for a long time. You can use them as guidelines.

For starter, please refer to [Gatsby Starter Library](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/) to find your suitable template and [Gatsby Documentation](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/) to build your own project.

However, I'm all open to hear feedback and comments to improve the project. Feel free to open an issue to discuss further!
