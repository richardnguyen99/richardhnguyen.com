If you are a developer, you are required to have your own blog. I mean seriously, having a blog is not only a mean to share your knowledge, but also a way to sharpen your skills. But where to begin and what tool to use? In this article, I will compare two popular tools for blogging: GatsbyJS and NextJS.

{/* Except */}

# Introduction

Both [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and [NextJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) have gained their notoriety for the past few years. They are built on top of ReactJS and are great for building blogs. With the engine of ReactJS and great modules from community, both can help you write your blog with modern technologies and great performance.

This article tends to provide a objective comparison between GatsbyJS and NextJS. Therefore, it's not a comprehensive tutorial to build a blog (separate tutorials will be provided in the future). You can use this article as a reference, and decide which framework works best for you.

These are criteria that I will use to compare GatsbyJS and NextJS. The higher the criteria is, the better the framework is.

1. Easy-to-use &mdash; How quickly and how easily can you get started and start writing your own blog? This will be measured by the number of lines of code you need to write to get your blog up and running. This also includes dependencies, libraries and plugins that you might need to get your blog up and running.
2. SEO &mdash; What does it take to make your blog SEO-friendly?
3. Performance &mdash; How fast is your blog? This will be measured by the [Lighthouse](https://developers.google.com/web/tools/lighthouse) score.
4. Deployment &mdash; How fast can you build your blog? What is the bundle size? How easy is it to deploy your blog?
5. Testing &mdash; How easy is it to set up a testing workflow for your blog? It can be from simple such as checking build, commit-hooks, and unit testing to more complex such as end-to-end testing and story book.
