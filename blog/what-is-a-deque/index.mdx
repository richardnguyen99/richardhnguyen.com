Many problems can be solved with arrays and their dynamic version. In Python, you can use the builtin [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html#more-on-lists). In C++, you use [`vector`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/vector/). But the drawback is that these dynamic array is terrible at insertion and deletion at the front due to shifting. Deque is created to solve this problem!

{/* Except */}

# Introduction

Deque, or **doubly-ended queue**, is a data structure created to solve the critical problem that dynamic arrays have: working with the front element.

As a reminder, dynamic arrays are great at inserting and deleting the last element in the array, thanks to the size property: appending new elements will increase the size. Assume there is no reallocation happening, the time complexity of this operation is constant.

However, inserting or deleting an element at some arbitary position will take linear time, $O(N)$ where $N$ is the distance between the position on which the operation performs and the position of the last element. This means working with the first element always yields the worst runtime. (Psst. I have a post about about [this](/posts/what-is-a-vector-in-cpp))

This is where deque comes in to "save the world"!

# What deque can do

What deque proposes and tries to solve is support insertion and deletion at the front of a container. You might wonder: "Has linked list already solved this problem?". That is correct. Insertion/deleteion at the front can be done with linked lists.

However, the problem with linked lists is that accessing elements takes linear time. The beauty of a deque is that it also supports constant access time (random access).

In summary, deque wants to solve the problem that dynamic arrays have, while still keeps their best traits.
