Have you heard the term _"dynamic array"_? As opposed to traditional arrays, whose size is fixed, dyanmic arrays can grow their size automatically when they need more space. You may have used [`java.util.ArrayList`](https://docs.oracle.com/javase/8/docs/api/java/util/ArrayList.html) in Java, or [`list`](https://docs.python.org/3/tutorial/datastructures.html) in Python. In C++, it has [`std::vector`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/container/vector). But have you wondered how these languages implemented this data structure? This article will answer that for you.

{/* Except */}

# Introduction

Vector is the [C++ Standard Template Library (STL)](https://cplusplus.com/reference/stl/) container that stores a collection of objects. Just like C-arrays, vector supports [Random (Direct) Access](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Random_access) and pointer-arithmetic operations. Unlike C-arrays, vectors support many other functionalities to make your day easier:

- **Dynamic reallocation _(this is our focus)_**
- Templated
- Iterators
- Memory management
- Functions to add, remove, modify and retrieve information.

Our focus in this article is _dynamic reallocation_. Basically, when a vector is about to run out of space for new elements, it will allocate a new space with a sufficient size, then copy the old elements from the original space to the new one. But how does it work? What are the necessary _member fields_ to accomplish it? How does the _dynamic reallocation_ mechanism under the programming perspective?

# Member fields

As mentioned above, STD vector acts exactly like traditional C-arrays. So, using an array internally would be a good idea. As it turns out, STD vector actually uses an internal C-array to store data. The C-array is dynamically allocated on the heap, which can be done over `malloc()`, `operator new`, or [`std::allocator`](https://en.cppreference.com/w/cpp/memory/allocator).

Before revealing what the member fields look like, there are some concerns that we need to address due to dynamic memory allocation:

1. We want to know where **the allocated space starts and ends**. Missing them can lead to a memory leak.
2. We want to know **how many elements there are**. Missing it can cause a severe overflow.

Dynamically-allocated memory operations always a pointer pointing to the first block. So we already know where it starts. Then, how do we keep track of how many elements and where does this array end?

A straight-forward solution is to have two member fields to the keep track of them. Let's name them `size` for the number of elements, and `cap` for the capacity of this array. Then we can just do pointer-arithmetic operations to work with them

```cpp title="vector.h"

class vector
{
  public:
    ...
  private:
    int *data;
    int size;
    int cap;
};
```

<div className="mt-8">

![image](./vector-size-cap.png "Vector with size and capacity")

</div>

Another way to do this is to use one pointer, `finish`, pointing to the next available space, and one pointer, `end`, pointing to pass-the-end of the array.

```cpp title=vector.h
class vector
{
  public:
    ...
  private:
    int *data;
    int *finish;
    int *end;
};
```

<div className="mt-8">

![image](./vector-two-pointers.png "Vector with two pointers")

</div>

There are some confusions why `finish` does not point to the last element, but to one-past it. The reason is that when appending a new element to the vector, you can directly assignment value to the space pointed by this pointer, and increase the pointer. This will reduce the code complexity and minimize the pointer-arithmetic operations. Another reason is that if you want to get the size of vector, it can be done by subtracting two pointers, `finish - data`.

Both approaches are valid. However, STD vector prefers the second approach to the first one. Therefore, I will use the second approach for the rest of the article.

# How growing works

Let's consider the most used method in STD vector, [`vector<T>::push_back`](https://cplusplus.com/reference/vector/vector/push_back/), which appends the new element to the back of the vector. The simple algorithm to achieve this goal is described as below:

1. Check if there is enough space (i.e. `end - finish > 0`).
2. If there is enough space, go to step 6. Otherwise continue.
3. Allocate a new space with a new, sufficient capacity.
4. Copy the values from the old array to the new one.
5. Free the space of the old array.
6. Append the new element to end.

If our vector has enough space, the work to append a new element is simple; _just assign it the space pointed by `finish` and increment the pointer_. However, if there is not enough space, our vector has to find a new space. Allocation, copying and deallocation are expensive operations.
