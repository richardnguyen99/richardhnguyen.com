HTTP, the foundation of the World Wide Web, allows us to transfer data from one computer to another in a reliable way. But how does one know when the data transfer is complete? Can one send a sufficiently large object over an HTTP message? And if not, how can one break it down?

{/* Except */}

# Why bother?

HTTP, stands for **Hyper Text Transfer Protocol**, is a protocol built on top of [TCP](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Transmission_Control_Protocol). TCP, in a nutshell, is a stream of bytes. For example, when a server wants send a message `"Hello, World"` to a client, TCP will send the message as a stream of bytes, like so:

```txt showWindowBar="false" showLineNumber="false"
server ---> 48 65 6c 6c 6f 2c 20 57 6f 72 6c 64 ---> client
```

The client will then receive the message as a stream of bytes, and it will decode the bytes into a string, `"Hello, World"`. But now, the client is asking itself: _"Is that it?"_

## Complete message?

There are many reasons to consider whether a received message is complete or not.

Old servers might have a fixed-sized buffer to send data. Many HTTP servers written in C use a stack-allocated array of some fixed size as a buffer to send data.

Modern servers might allow the buffer to store the whole data. But due to the nature of TCP, the server can only try its best to send as many bytes as possible[^1]. The short answer is that TCP is a **stream-oriented** connection, which means the message is not guaranteed to be received as a whole. It might be received with the first line, 1KB of the content, or the whole message. The only guarantee is that the bytes will be received in the same order as they were sent.

## Special characters?

You might be asking.: _"Can we just simply add newlines '\n' to the end of the message and stop reading when first encountering it?"_

Well, what if the received message is just the first line of the whole message that the server wants to send? What if the server wants to send a message that contains newlines?

_"Well then, we might use '\r\n' for the end of message while '\n' is for the newline characters"_.

That might be a good idea. But Windows uses `\r\n` as the official newline character, and certainly we don't want to discriminate Windows users, do we? Even that's something you want to do, which I highly discourage, HTTP messages use `\r\n` as the end of line character:

```http showWindowBar="false"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
Header-1: value-1\r\n
Header-2: value-2\r\n
<more-headers>
\r\n
<content>
```

In fact, this is the standard for all Internet protocols[^2], not just for the HTTP protocol.

## Maybe we can inform the client?

Luckily, HTTP provides a schema of messages so that client knows how to interpret the message.

<br />

![http-message-format](http-message-format.png "HTTP Message Format")

The example above is a HTTP response message:

1. The first line is the starting line, which contains the HTTP version, the status code, and the status message.
2. The following lines are the headers, which contains the metadata of the message. To mark the end of the headers, follow a blank line.
3. The rest of the message is the content.

Take a look at the `Content-Length` header. It tells the client how many bytes the content is. So, the client can read the content until it reaches the number of bytes specified in the `Content-Length` header.

# Content-Length Header

The purpose of the header `Content-Length` is to inform the client (mostly the user browsers) how many bytes the content contains exactly. Since TCP, as mentioned above, might send the message in multiple packets, the client must know when to stop reading the content and move on to other tasks.

## Implementation

To construct a response message with the `Content-Length` header, the server must know the size of the content beforehand. For static files such as HTML pages, the server can easily compute the value of the `Content-Length` header. Most programming languages provide a way to get the size of a file.

<CodeSwitcher>

```c title="server.c" tab="1"
int fd = open("index.html", O_RDONLY);      // Open static files
struct stat st;                             // File metadata
fstat(fd, &st);

// Response message template
char *response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
                 "Content-Length: %ld\r\n"  // Content-Length header
                 "\r\n"
                 "%s";

char *content = mmap(NULL, st.st_size,      // Map file to memory
                     PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE,
                     fd, 0);


// Construct response message
char *message = malloc(strlen(response) + st.st_size);
sprintf(message, response, st.st_size, content);

// Send response message to client
ssize_t sent = 0;<span class="mtk3 mtki"
while (sent < strlen(message)) {
    ssize_t n = send(client_fd, message + sent, strlen(message) - sent, 0)
    if (n == -1) {
        perror("send");
        exit(1);
    }
    sent += n;
}

// Free resources
unmap(content, st.st_size);
free(message);
close(fd);
```

```py title="server.py" tab="1"

f = open("index.html", "rb")                # Open static files
content = f.read()                          # Read file content

# Response message template
response = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"      \
           "Content-Length: %d\r\n"   \
           "\r\n"                     \
           "%s"

# Construct response message
message = response % (len(content), content)
```

</CodeSwitcher>

## Notes to consider

- If `Content-Length` header is present with a value, the receiving end only reads the content within the specified number of bytes.
  1. If the content is less than the value of `Content-Length` header, the message is considered incomplete, and the receiving end will close the connection.
  2. If the content is more than the value of `Content-Length` header, the receiving end will read the content until it reaches the value of `Content-Length` header, and the rest of the content will be discarded.
- If `Content-Length` header is not present, the receiving end will read the content until it reaches the end of the connection.

[RFC 7230 - Section 3.32](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-3.3.2) defines the `Content-Length` header more detailed.

<PageBreak />

# Chunked Transfer Encoding

The `Content-Length` header is a great way to inform the client how many bytes the content is. But what if the server doesn't know the size of the content beforehand? What if the server wants to send a large file to the client? What if the server wants to send a stream of data to the client?

## Unknown content length

There are some situations where the sever cannot compute the size of the content before sending the response. It could be a video stream, or a result of SQL queries. In these cases, the server cannot use the `Content-Length` header to inform the client how many bytes the content is.

## Implementation

Like `Content-Length` header, the `Transfer-Encoding` header is used to inform the receiving end how to interpret the message, and when to stop reading the content. In HTTP messages, the `Transfer-Encoding` can be used as below:

```http showWindowBar="false"
HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n
Transfer-Encoding: chunked\r\n
...
```

The tricky part is the content itself, or more specifically, the way the content is encoded. [RFC 7230 - Section 4.1](https://datatracker.ietf.org/doc/html/rfc7230#section-4.1) defines the `chunked` transfer encoding as below:

```txt showWindowBar="false" showLineNumber="false"
chunked-body   = *chunk
                last-chunk
                trailer-part
                CRLF

chunk          = chunk-size [ chunk-ext ] CRLF
                chunk-data CRLF
chunk-size     = 1*HEXDIG
last-chunk     = 1*("0") [ chunk-ext ] CRLF

chunk-data     = 1*OCTET ; a sequence of chunk-size octets
```

Now, I admit, the definition above seems a bit confusing. However, we can break it down into smaller and simpler parts. Every chunked content has multiple chunks, (`*chunk` means multiple chunks), the last chunk and `CRLF` (`\r\n`).

Each chunk has 2 major parts: the size of a chunk and the chunk itself.

- The size of a chunk is a hexadecimal number followed by a `CRLF` to determine the size of the chunk.
- The chunk, or the content, is a sequence of bytes with the size specified in the previous step.

The last chunk, or the _terminal_ chunk, is a specical in which there is no content. This last chunk is the signal to the receiving end that the message is complete.

## Example

Let's say we have a message looks like as below:

```txt title="message"
IT will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and
grub -worm of a poor devil of a Sub -Sub appears to have gone
through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, pick-
ing up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways
...
```

The content can be arbitarily large and the server doesn't know the size of the content beforehand. We can only send the message line-by-line. Then, the chunked messages can be broken down into:

```txt title="chunked message"
33\r\n
IT will be seen that this mere painstaking burrower and\r\n
3D\r\n
grub -worm of a poor devil of a Sub -Sub appears to have gone\r\n
40\r\n
through the long Vaticans and street-stalls of the earth, pick-\r\n
3C\r\n
ing up whatever random allusions to whales he could anyways\r\n
...
0\r\n
\r\n
```

We treat each line as one chunk. For every chunk, we calculate the size of the chunk, followed by the chunk itself. The receiving end will read all the chunks and concatenate them into one message. Then, the last chunked message, `0\r\n\r\n`, is the signal to the receiving end that the message is complete.

<Callout title="Note" type="warning">

1. HTTP requires the existence of the last chunk in order to determine the end of the message. If the last chunk is missing, the receiving end will either hang waiting for the last chunk if the connection is still alive, or it will yeild an error as <span className="text-amber-500">incomplete message</span> if the sending end has closed the connection.
2. The receiving end might stop reading the content prematurely if the last chunk is present, even where the message is not complete.

</Callout>

# Which one?

## Content-Length

The rule of thumb when considering which header to use in your code is to use `Content-Length` header if you know the exact size of the content before sending.

`Content-Length` header has some advantages. First, it's simple to implement because you let TCP handle sending the content itself. Second, it only sends what it needs to send, as it doesn't ship extra bytes such as `\r\n` to accomodate the format of chunked encoding.

## Chunked Transfer Encoding

With that being said, there is only one reason to use `Transfer-Encoding: chunked` over `Content-Length`. If the content is large and the server doesn't know the size of the content beforehand. In this case, the server can send the content line-by-line, or chunk-by-chunk with fixed size. Thanks to the format
of chunked transfer encoding, the receiving end can read all the chunks and build them into one final message.
