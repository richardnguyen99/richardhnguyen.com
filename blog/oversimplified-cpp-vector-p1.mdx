`std::vector` is a C++ template class that allows contiguous elements with an abilility of growing and shrinking automatically. It's widely used by many C++ developers in many projects because it provides a set of public methods to deal with dynamic allocation.

# Introduction

In a nutshell, `std::vector` is C++ template class which wraps a native C-style array. However, instead of using C-style `malloc` or `realloc` to handle dynamic size, it uses a passed-in allocator by users (which by default is `std::allocator`).

So the whole idea of `std::vector` is resizing when there is no space to add new items. It's done by allocating a new array and copy-constructing each element in the new array from the old one. So in this article, I will show my oversimplified version of `std::vector`

# Design

There are many approaches to replicate the C++ vector class. However, there are two major approaches that are both widely accepted:

```cpp
template <class _Tp, class _Alloc = std::allocator<_Tp>>
class vector {
public:
    // public member functions
private:
    _Tp*                  _data;      // Storage for all elements
    typename A::size_type _capacity;  // Maximum elements can be stored
    typename A::size_type _size;      // Current elements are stored
    _Alloc                _alloc;
};
```

```cpp
template <class _Tp, class _Alloc = std::allocator<_Tp>>
class vector {
public:
    // public member functions
private:
    _Tp*    _start;     // points to first element
    _Tp*    _end;       // points to one past internal storage
    _Tp*    _finish;    // points to one past last element
    _Alloc  _alloc;
};
```

Both are interchangeably accepted to store and work with a native C-style array because they hold data members that can tell the capacity and the size of the vector, which are both crucial in a vector object. In the first approach, it can tell those obvious information by querying `_capacity` and `_size`. Meanwhile, the second approach uses arithmetic operation on pointers, `_end - _first` and `_finish - _first`, to get the capacity and size respectively.

Since the second approach is easier to access and work with elements, which are directly by pointers, in the array, the second approach is used in the STL vector class and it will be the approach I use in this series.
