C strings are notoriously difficult to use and easy to mess up, for both
beginners and experienced. If you come from other programming languages, C
strings can cause a lot of headaches due to its lack of supporting ordinary
features to work with strings that you might see in other programming languages.

{/* Except */}

# 1. Array of characters

Strings in C are defined as an array of chracters. While type character, `char`,
is a primitive data type in C, strings are not. Therefore, you can assign
strings to variables like these:

```c
char *str1 = "Hello world";
char str2[] = "Hello world";
char str3[] = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', ' ', 'w', 'o', 'r', 'l', 'd', '\0'};
char str4[12] = "Hello world";
```
The first two examples are special syntaxes that the compiler can understand
and create two arrays of characters for you. The only difference is that the
double-quoted string in the second example specifies the initial values of the
character in the array, whereas the first one creates a _static, read-only_
string in memory and assign the address to the pointer `str1`.[^1]

<Callout collapsible type="info" title="Fun fact">

In memory, the first example will create a readonly string in the `.rodata`,
which is a section in the binary that stores read-only data such as string
literals. Those are created at compile time and cannot be modified during
runtime.

You can test this by creating two strings with the same content and compare
their addresses.

```c title="main.c"
char hello1[]   = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
char hello2[]   = {'H', 'e', 'l', 'l', 'o', '\0'};
char *constant1 = "template string";
char *constant2 = "template string";

printf("Address of hello1: %p\n", hello1);
printf("Address of hello2: %p\n", hello2);
printf("Address of constant1: %p\n", constant1);
printf("Address of constant2: %p\n", constant2);
```

Output:

```text title="Output" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
Address of hello1: 0x7ffe2cb51346
Address of hello2: 0x7ffe2cb51340
Address of constant1: 0x402010
Address of constant2: 0x402010
```

</Callout>

The third example allows you to explicitly define the array of characters.
However, you need to append the null terminator character, `\0`, at the end of
the array to indicate the end of the string. Otherwise, other functions can keep
reading pass the array and cause undefined behaviors.

The last example is simply for readability. Similar to the second example where
the compiler can infer the size of the array from the string literal, the third
one allows you to explicitly define the size of the array.

<Callout collapsible title="Note" type="warning">

In the last example, the size of array must be at least 12 to include the null
terminator character. Otherwise, the compiler will complain about the size of
the array is too small.

```c title="main.c"
char too_long_str[12] = "This initializer string exceeds the size of the array";
printf("%s\n", too_long_str);
```

Output:

```bash title="Output" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
main.c: In function 'main':
main.c:13:29: warning: initializer-string for array of 'char' is too long
      |     char too_long_str[12] = "This initializer string exceeds the size of the array";
      |                             ^~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~~
This initial
```

</Callout>

# 2. Modifying C strings

Programming languages like Java and Python have immutable strings, which means
once you create a string, you cannot modify it. C, on the other hand, allows you
to modify strings in place because to C, strings are just arrays of characters.

```c title="main.c"
char str[] = "Hello world";
str[0] = 'h';
printf("%s\n", str);
```

Output:

```bash title="Output" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
hello world
```

C also provides a set of functions to directly modify strings. For example,

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <ctype.h>

int main()
{
    char str[] = "Hello world";

    // Uppercase all characters
    for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; ++i) {
      str[i] = toupper(str[i]);
    }

    printf("%s\n", str);

    // Lower case all characters
    for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; ++i) {
      str[i] = tolower(str[i]);
    }

    printf("%s\n", str);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text title="Output" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
HELLO WORLD
hello world
```

<Callout title="Note" type="warning">

C allows you to directly modify strings as long as those changes are within the
boundaries of the array. Another limitation is that you cannot change the size
of the array. If you need to change the size of the string, you need to create a
new array and copy the content of the old array to the new one.

As mentioned in the previous section, in order to modify strings, you need to
create one with `char[]` instead of `char *`, because the latter creates a
readonly string and cannot be modified.

</Callout>

# 3. Size and iteration

One easy way to get the size of a string is to iterate through the array and
count the number of characters until the null terminator character is reached.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char str[] = "Hello world";
    int size = 0;

    for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; ++i) {
      ++size;
    }

    // or
    for (char *p = str; *p != '\0'; ++p) {
      ++size;
    }


    printf("Size of string: %d\n", size);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text title="Output" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
Size of string: 11
```

However, this is not efficient and can be troublesome if you're not careful.
Luckily, C provides a function to get the size of a string called
[`strlen(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strlen.3.html).

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char str[] = "Hello world";
    int size = strlen(str);

    printf("Size of string: %d\n", size);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text title="Output" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
Size of string: 11
```

<Callout title="Note" type="info">

Another way to get the size of a string is to use the `sizeof` operator.

```c title="main.c"
size_t size = sizeof(str) / sizeof(str[0]); // 12
```

However, this method is not recommended because it also counts the null
terminator character.

</Callout>

# 4. String comparison

An intuitive way to compare two strings is to iterate through two strings and
compare one-by-one character. However, C provides a set of string-comparison
functions to save the troubles for you

## `strcmp` and `strncmp`

[`strcmp`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strcmp.3.html) is the most
commonly used function to compare two strings.

Meanwhile, `strncmp` is similar to `strcmp` but allows you to specify the number
of characters to compare. This is useful when you want to compare a substring
of two strings such checking if two strings have the same prefix.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char str1[] = "Hello world";
    char str2[] = "Hello world";
    char str3[] = "hello world";

    printf("str1 == str2: %d\n", strcmp(str1, str2));
    printf("str1 == str3: %d\n", strcmp(str1, str3));
    printf("str2 == str3: %d\n", strcmp(str2, str3));
    printf("(last word) str1 == str3: %d\n", strncmp(str1 + 6, str3 + 6, 5));

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text title="Output" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
str1 == str2: 0
str1 == str3: -32
str2 == str3: -32
(last word) str1 == str3: 0
```

The return value of `strcmp` and `strncmp` returns `0` if the two strings are
equal, a negative value if the first string is less than the second string, and
a positive value if the first string is greater than the second string. To know
what the value means exactly, you might want to refer to the documentation.

## `strcasecmp` and `strncasecmp`

Addition to `strcmp`, [`strcasecmp`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strcasecmp.3.html)
is another function to compare two strings but ignores the case of the strings.

This is useful when you want to compare two strings but don't care about their
cases such as checking two headers in HTTP requests.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char *request_header = "Content-Type";
    char *content_type_header = "content-type";
    char *content_length_header = "content-length";

    printf("request_header == content_type_header: %d\n",
            strcmp(request_header, content_type_header));

    printf("(same prefix) request_header == content_length_header: %d\n",
            strcmp(request_header, content_length_header, 7));

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text title="Output" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
request_header == content_type_header: 0
(same prefix) request_header == content_length_header: 0
```

# 5. String copy

## `strcpy`

String copy can be done by iterating through the source string and copy each
character to the destination string. However, C provides a function to do this
for you.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char str1[] = "Hello world";
    char str2[12];

    strcpy(str2, str1);
    printf("str2: %s\n", str2);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text title="Output" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
str2: Hello world
```

## `strncpy`

`strncpy` is similar to `strcpy` but allows you to specify the number of characters
to copy. This is useful when you want to copy a substring of a string.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char str1[] = "Hello world";
    char str2[6];

    strncpy(str2, str1 + 6, 5);
    printf("str2: %s\n", str2);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text title="Output" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
str2: world
```

<Callout title="Note" type="info">

`strcpy` and `strncpy` do not check the size of the destination string. It is
the responsibility of the programmer to make sure that the destination string
has enough space to store the source string, including the null terminator, i.e.
`strlen(src) + 1`.

</Callout>

## `strdup`

While `strcpy` and `strcpy` requires you to create the destination string and
make sure it has enough space on your own, [`strdup(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strdup.3.html)
and [`strndup(3)`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/strdup.3.html) will
do those things for you.

The only drawback is that since the returned string is dynamically allocated,
you need to free it to avoid memory leaks. Also, as a result of dynamic
allocation, you might also want to check if the allocation is successful.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char str1[] = "Hello world";
    char *str2 = strdup(str1);
    char *str3 = strndup(str1, 5);

    if (str2 == NULL) {
      printf("Failed to allocate memory\n");
      return 1;
    }

    printf("str2: %s\n", str2);
    printf("str3: %s\n", str3);

    free(str2);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text title="Output" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
str2: Hello world
str3: Hello
```

# 6. String concatenation

Programming languages like Java and Python provide an overloaded `operator+()`
to concatenate two strings. C, on the other hand, does not provide such thing.
However, C provides a set of functions to achieve the same results

## In-place concatenation

[`strcat`](https://linux.die.net/man/3/strcat) allows you to append a string to
an original string, and override the null terminator if need. Similar to `strcpy`,
you need to make sure that the original string has enough space to store the
appended string, i.e. `strlen(dest) + strlen(src) + 1`.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char str1[12] = "Hello";
    char str2[] = " world";

    strcat(str1, str2);
    printf("str1: %s\n", str1);

    return 0;
}
```

## New strings with `malloc`

If you don't want to modify the original strings while concatenating them, you
can create a new string and copy the content of the original strings to the new
one.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char str1[] = "Hello";
    char str2[] = " world";

    // Make sure to allocate enough space for the null terminator (+1)
    char *str3 = malloc(strlen(str1) + strlen(str2) + 1);

    if (str3 == NULL) {
      printf("Failed to allocate memory\n");
      return 1;
    }

    strcpy(str3, str1);
    strcat(str3, str2);

    printf("str3: %s\n", str3);

    free(str3);

    return 0;
}
```

## New strings with `char[]`

Allocating memory with `malloc` can be troublesome. If the string is relatively
small, you can create a new string with `char[]` and copy the content of the
original strings to the new one.

In order to determine the size of the new string, you can use `strlen` to get
the size of the original strings and add `1` for the null terminator.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char str1[] = "Hello";
    char str2[] = " world";
    char str3[strlen(str1) + strlen(str2) + 1];

    strcpy(str3, str1);
    strcat(str3, str2);

    printf("str3: %s\n", str3);

    return 0;
}
```

Another way is to determine the maximum size of your string. This is useful when
your application requires a fixed-size buffer to store the string, like HTTP
headers

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define MAX_HEADER_SIZE 1024

int main()
{
    char str1[] = "Hello";
    char str2[] = " world";
    char str3[MAX_HEADER_SIZE];

    strcpy(str3, str1);
    strcat(str3, str2);

    printf("str3: %s\n", str3);

    return 0;
}
```

## New string with string literals

C allows you to concatenate string literals togehter.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char *str1 = "Hello" " " "world";

    printf("str1: %s\n", str1);

    return 0;
}
```

The above syntax is extremely useful when you have string literals as macros.
For example, you can define a macro to change the color of the text in the
terminal.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

#define RED "\033[0;31m"
#define GREEN "\033[0;32m"
#define RESET "\033[0m"

int main()
{
    char *str1 = RED "Hello" RESET " " GREEN "world" RESET " from C";

    printf("str1: %s\n", str1);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

<Output>

str1: <span class="text-red-500">Hello</span> <span class="text-lime-400">world</span> from C

</Output>

# 7. String breaking

In particular programs, you might encounter strings that are too long to fit in
a single readable line. In this case, you can break the string into multiple
lines by using the `\` character. This is used in almost CLI programs written in
C. For example, [`coreutils/cat`](https://github.com/coreutils/coreutils/blob/master/src/cat.c#L91C1-L122C4)
uses this technique to break the help message into multiple lines.

```c title="main.c"
const char *helpmsg = "\
Usage: cat [OPTION]... [FILE]...\n\
Concatenate FILE(s) to standard output.\n\
\n\
With no FILE, or when FILE is -, read standard input.\n\
\n\
  -A, --show-all           equivalent to -vET\n\
  -b, --number-nonblank    number nonempty output lines, overrides -n\n\
  -e                       equivalent to -vE\n\
  -E, --show-ends          display $ at end of each line\n\
  -n, --number             number all output lines\n\
  -s, --squeeze-blank      suppress repeated empty output lines\n\
  -t                       equivalent to -vT\n\
  -T, --show-tabs          display TAB characters as ^I\n\
  -u                       (ignored)\n\
  -v, --show-nonprinting   use ^ and M- notation, except for LFD and TAB\n\
  --help                   display this help and exit\n\
  --version                output version information and exit\n\
";
```

You can break a string into multiple lines using string literals.

```c title="main.c"
const char *http_request_template = "GET / HTTP/1.1\r\n"
                                    "Host: %s\r\n"
                                    "User-Agent: %s\r\n"
                                    "Accept: */*\r\n"
                                    "\r\n";
```

# 8. String templating

Another features that other programming languages have but C does not is string
templating/interpolation. For example, in Python, you can use the `f-string`, or
in JavaScript, you can use the template literal `` `${}` `` syntax to interpolate variables
into a string.

<CodeSwitcher maxHeight={180}>

```python title="main.py" tab="1"
name = input("What is your name? ")
print(f"Hello {name}")
```

```js title="main.js" tab="2"
const name = prompt("What is your name? ");
console.log(`Hello ${name}`);
```

</CodeSwitcher>

## With stack-based strings

In C, you can use [`sprintf`](https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man3/sprintf.3p.html)
to achieve the same result. However, as usual, you need to make sure that the
destination string has enough space to store the interpolated string.

```c title="main.c"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <string.h>

int main()
{
    char name[32];
    char greeting[64];

    printf("What is your name? ");
    scanf("%s", name);

    sprintf(greeting, "Hello %s", name);

    printf("%s\n", greeting);

    return 0;
}
```

You can extent this technique to apply on template files such as HTML files
where there are placeholders that you want to replace with actual values.


<CodeSwitcher>

```html title="index.html" tab="1"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>%s</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello %s</h1>
  </body>
</html>

```

```c title="main.c" tab="2"
#define _GNU_SOURCE

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main()
{
    int fd = open("index.html", O_RDONLY);

    if (fd == -1)
    {
        perror("open");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    struct stat sb;
    if (fstat(fd, &sb) == -1)
    {
        perror("fstat");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    char *template = (char *)mmap(NULL, sb.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);

    if (template == MAP_FAILED)
    {
        perror("mmap");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    char rendered_html[2048];
    sprintf(rendered_html, template, "An example", "human");

    printf("%s\n", rendered_html);
    munmap(template, sb.st_size);

    return 0;
}
```

```text title="Output" tab="3"
<!DOCTYPE html>
<html>
  <head>
    <meta charset="utf-8" />
    <meta name="viewport" content="width=device-width, initial-scale=1.0" />
    <title>An example</title>
  </head>
  <body>
    <h1 class="text-3xl font-bold underline">Hello human</h1>
  </body>
</html>
```
</CodeSwitcher>

The problem with this approach is that you need to make sure that the size of
the destination string is large enough to store the interpolated string. For
example:

```c title="main.c"
const char *template = "You entered %d";

char str[13];
snprintf(str, 13, template, 123456789);
```

This might cause a buffer overflow because the size of the destination string is
smaller than what is required to store the interpolated string. Buffer overflow
can cause undefined behaviors, which are not detected by the compiler and also
hard to catch during runtime.

<Callout title="Use `snprintf`" type="success">

`sprintf` is not safe because neither does it check the size of the destination
nor give you a way to specify the size of the destination string. Instead, you
can use `snprintf`. It allows you to specify the size of the destination string
and the function will not write more than the size you specified.

</Callout>


## With dynamic strings

It is sometimes hard to determine the correct size of the destination array in
some situations. Let's consider the following example where you want to return
an HTTP response with an HTML page.

```c title="main.c"
#define _GNU_SOURCE

#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>
#include <string.h>
#include <unistd.h>
#include <fcntl.h>
#include <sys/mman.h>
#include <sys/stat.h>

int main()
{
    int fd = open("index.html", O_RDONLY);

    if (fd == -1)
    {
        perror("open");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    struct stat sb;
    if (fstat(fd, &sb) == -1)
    {
        close(fd);
        perror("fstat");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    char *html_str = (char *)mmap(NULL, sb.st_size, PROT_READ, MAP_PRIVATE, fd, 0);

    if (html_str == MAP_FAILED)
    {
        close(fd);
        perror("mmap");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    char *response = NULL;
    const char *template = "HTTP/1.1 200 OK\r\n"
                           "Content-Type: text/html\r\n"
                           "Content-Length: %ld\r\n"
                           "\r\n"
                           "%s";

    asprintf(&response, template, sb.st_size, html_str);

    if (response == NULL)
    {
        close(fd);
        munmap(html_str, sb.st_size);
        perror("asprintf");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf("%s\n", response);

    close(fd);
    munmap(html_str, sb.st_size);
    free(response);

    return 0;
}
```

Output:

```text title="HTTP Response" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
HTTP/1.1 200 OK
Content-Type: text/html

In this example, you don't need to worry about the size of the destination
string because `asprintf` will calculate the correct size and allocate the
string for you. The only drawback is that you need to check and free the
allocated string manually.

# 9. Strings as paramaters

In C, strings are passed as pointers to the first character of the string. That
implies two things:

The string parameters are new pointers that point to the same memory address as
the original string. Modifying the content to which the new pointers point will
also modify the original string.

## With `char *`

The most simple way to pass a string as a parameter is to use `char *`.

```c title="read_str.c"
void read_str(char *str)
{
  for (int i = 0; str[i] != '\0'; ++i) {
    printf("%c", str[i]);
  }
}
```

This function assumes that your string is correctly initialized. With the help
of the null terminator character, you can iterate through the string and read
each character until the null terminator character is reached.

## With `size_t`

In most case, you need to retrieve the size of the array. With only one string
as parameter, you can use `strlen` to get the size of the string. However,
`strlen` will iterate through the string every time you call it. This is
inefficient if you need to call it multiple times.

To increase a bit of performance, you can pass the size of the string as an
extra parameter.

```c title="read_str.c"
void read_str(char *str, size_t size)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    printf("%c", str[i]);
  }
}
```

## With `const`

If you don't have an intention to modify the string, you might want to use
`const` to indicate that the string is readonly and prevent accidental
modification.

```c title="read_str.c"
void read_str(const char *str, size_t size)
{
  for (int i = 0; i < size; ++i) {
    printf("%c", str[i]);
  }
}
```

# 10. Return strings

Unlike other programming languages, C does not allow you to return strings
directly from a function. However, there are 3 ways to work around this.

## Why not return directly?

Consider an intuitive way to return a string from a function.

```c title="str.c"

char *get_str()
{
    char str[BUFLEN];
    snprintf(str, BUFLEN, "Hello, world!");

    return str;
}

```

But when we compile it with `gcc`, we get the following warning:

<Output enableCopy={false}>

str.c: In function 'get_str':

str.c:10:12: <span class="text-violet-500">warning</span>: function returns address of local variable [<span class="text-violet-500">-Wreturn-local-addr</span>]

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;10 |&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;return <span class="text-violet-500">str</span>;

&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;|&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;<span class="text-violet-500">^~~</span>

</Output>

The array `str` is a chunk of memory allocated on the stack in the scope of
the function `get_str`. `str` points to the first character of the array.
When the function returns, the stack frame is popped and the memory chunk ceases
to exist. Therefore, the pointer `str` has nothing to point to and becomes
invalid.

## With `static`

The first way is to return a pointer to a static string. This is similar to
returning a pointer to a string literal.

<CodeSwitcher maxHeight={280}>

```c title="static_str.c" tab="1"
#define BUFLEN 1024

char *get_static_str(void)
{
  static char str[BUFLEN];

  snprintf(str, BUFLEN, "Hello world");

  return str
}
```

```c title="main.c" tab="2"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    char *static_str = get_static_str();

    printf("Content of static_str: %s\n", static_str);
    printf("Address of static_str: %p\n", static_str);

    return 0;
}
```

```text title="Output" tab="3" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
Content of static_str: Hello world
Address of static_str: 0x404040
```

</CodeSwitcher>

Static strings are created once and live throughout the lifetime of the program.
Therefore, you don't need to worry about the lifetime of the string. However,
since the string is shared among all calls to the function, you need to make
sure that the string is used with caution.

## With stack-based strings

The second way is to create an empty array of characters and pass it as an
argument. As mentioned above, modifying the content of the array will also
modify the original string.

<CodeSwitcher>

```c title="stack_str.c" tab="1"
int get_stack_str(char *str, size_t size)
{
  snprintf(str, size, "Hello, world!");

  return 0;
}
```

```c title="main.c" tab="2"
#include <stdio.h>

int main()
{
    // Your responsibility to make sure that the size is sufficient
    char str[14];

    int ret = get_stack_str(str, 14);

    printf("Content of str: %s\n", str);
    printf("Address of str: %p\n", str);

    return 0;
}
```

```text title="Output" tab="3" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
Content of stack_str: Hello, world!
Address of stack_str: 0x7fff502c2e96
```

</CodeSwitcher>

Most of the C string functions use this technique such as `strcpy`, `strcat`.
The only drawback is that you need to make sure the size of the parameterized
string is large enough to store the returned string.

Since you already use an argument to store the returned string, you can use
the return value to indicate the status of the function. In most C functions,
`0` indicates success and `-1` indicates failure.

## With `malloc`

The third way is to use `malloc` to allocate memory for the string. This is
similar to the technique used in `strdup` and `strndup`.

<CodeSwitcher>

```c title="malloc_str.c" tab="1"

char *get_heap_str()
{
    char *str = (char *)malloc(14);

    if (str == NULL) {
      return NULL;
    }

    snprintf(str, 14, "Hello, world!");

    return str;
}
```

```c title="main.c" tab="2"
#include <stdio.h>
#include <stdlib.h>

int main()
{
    char *heap_str = get_heap_str();

    if (heap_str == NULL)
    {
        perror("get_heap_str:malloc");
        exit(EXIT_FAILURE);
    }

    printf("Content of heap_str: %s\n", heap_str);
    printf("Address of heap_str: %p\n", heap_str);

    free(heap_str);

    return 0;
}
```

```text title="Output" tab="3" showLineNumber=false enableCopy=false
Content of heap_str: Hello, world!
Address of heap_str: 0x211e2a0
```

</CodeSwitcher>

This technique can extent to other dynamically-allocated string functions such
as `asprintf` and `strdup`. The allocated string is created on the heap and
the object will live there until you free it. That's why you can return the
string because the memory is still valid. The same drawback in any dynamic
allocation is that you need to keep track and free the allocated memory to
avoid memory leaks.

# Conclusion

Other programming languages provide string-support features and abstract away
the details of working with strings. C, on the other hand, does not provide such
features. You have the total control over how you want to create and use strings,
with some extra help from the standard library. It's also easier to mess up with
C strings over small things such as forgetting to append the null terminator.

Working with C strings might be frustrating due to its lack of supporting,
especially if you come from other programming languages. Therefore, I hope this
article can make your work with C a bit easier.
