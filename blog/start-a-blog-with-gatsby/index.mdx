If you are a developer, you are **required** to have a blog for yourself. I mean
_SERIOUSLY, you should have one ASAP_. Not only is it a place to share your
knowledge, but it also helps you understand the topic better. But, how should
you start? What tool should you use and where do you host your blog? There are
tons of options out there but [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) stands out
as the best choice for me.

# Introduction

GatsbyJS is a static site generator that uses React and GraphQL to build
static websites. It is fast, easy to use, and has a large community. There is
an official documentation as well as a a large plugin library that help you
build a blog without sweating.

> In a nutshell, a static site generator takes whatever you write and generates
> everything sites (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) at build time. They're fast and many
> cloud providers offer free hosting for static sites. The only downsite is that
> you cannot have dynamic content (e.g. comments, search, etc.), at least not
> without some tweaks and workarounds.

As mentioned above, there are many options out there for you to get started.
There is no rationale behind my choice; I simply like it and I hope this
article will make you feel so. Nonetheless, there are some upsides that GatsbyJS
stands out:

- **React** &mdash; No need to talk more React. It stood the test of time and
  still one of the best front-end libraries, especially for starters.
- **GraphQL** &mdash; Basically a way to query data to render your site.
- **Plugins** &mdash; Tons of plugins, both community and official, to help you
  solve common problems.
