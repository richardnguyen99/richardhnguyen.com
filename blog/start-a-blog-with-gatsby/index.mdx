If you are a developer, you are **required** to have a blog for yourself. I mean
_SERIOUSLY, you should have one ASAP_. Not only is it a place to share your
knowledge, but it also helps you understand the topic better. But, how should
you start? What tool should you use and where do you host your blog? There are
tons of options out there but [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) stands out
as the best choice for me.

{/* Except */}

# Introduction

GatsbyJS is a static site generator that uses React and GraphQL to build
static websites. It is fast, easy to use, and has a large community. There is
an official documentation as well as a a large plugin library that help you
build a blog without sweating.

> In a nutshell, a static site generator takes whatever you write and generates
> everything sites (HTML, CSS, JS, etc.) at build time. They're fast and many
> cloud providers offer free hosting for static sites. The only downsite is that
> you cannot have dynamic content (e.g. comments, search, etc.), at least not
> without some tweaks and workarounds.

As mentioned above, there are many options out there for you to get started.
There is no rationale behind my choice; I simply like it and I hope this
article will make you feel so. Nonetheless, there are some upsides that GatsbyJS
stands out:

- **React** &mdash; No need to talk more React. It stood the test of time and
  still one of the best front-end libraries, especially for starters.
- **GraphQL** &mdash; Basically a way to query data to render your site.
- **Plugins** &mdash; Tons of plugins, both community and official, to help you
  solve common problems.

# Getting started

The purpose of this post is to help you write your first blog with Gatsby. There
are many plugins and libraries that I might use to build my blog. It's best if
you can follow along to get started. You can try to change things up later.

## Prerequisites

These are some tools that I might use:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.org/en/) &mdash; I recommend using the latest LTS
  version.
- [Yarn](https://yarnpkg.com/) &mdash; A package manager for NodeJS. You can use
  `npm` if you want but I prefer `yarn`.
- [VSCode](https://code.visualstudio.com/) &mdash; A code editor. You can use
  any editor you want but I recommend VSCode for its ease of use and
  extensibility.
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/) &mdash; A version control system. You can use
  GitHub Desktop if you want but I recommend using Git from the command line.
- [Gatsby ClI](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/docs/reference/gatsby-cli/) &mdash; A
  command line tool to help you create and manage Gatsby projects.

_Note_ that you might need to set up these tools in order to follow.

## Set up

Gatsby CLI has a very nice command to help you create a new project. It will ask
you a couple of preferences for your site. You can choose whatever you want but
in order to follow the tutorial, you should choose the following:

First, you might to create a new folder for your project. I will name it `gatsby-blog-mdx`.

```bash
mkdir gatsby-blog-mdx

```

```txt
$ gatsby new

create-gatsby version 3.7.0



                                                                                                     Welcome to Gatsby!

This command will generate a new Gatsby site for you in /home/youknowwhoe/github/gatsby-blog-mdx with the setup you select. Let's answer some questions:



What would you like to call your site?
âœ” Â· start-a-blog-with-gatsby-2023
What would you like to name the folder where your site will be created?
âœ” gatsby-blog-mdx/ start-a-blog-with-gatsby-2023
âœ” Will you be using JavaScript or TypeScript?
Â· TypeScript
âœ” Will you be using a CMS?
Â· No (or I'll add it later)
âœ” Would you like to install a styling system?
Â· No (or I'll add it later)
âœ” Would you like to install additional features with other plugins?
Â· Add responsive images
Â· Generate a manifest file


Thanks! Here's what we'll now do:

    ðŸ›   Create a new Gatsby site in the folder start-a-blog-with-gatsby-2023
    ðŸ”Œ Install gatsby-plugin-image, gatsby-plugin-manifest, gatsby-plugin-mdx


? Shall we do this? (Y/n) â€£ Yes
