# Introduction

It's great to have a place for you to introduce yourself and show off your knowledge, especially you are a developer. Maintaining a personal blog is an effective way to let people know what you have in the pocket. But I found that the process can be intimidating and frustrating because there are so many technologies and frameworks. Which one to choose?

One day, while doing my research, I discovered [GatsbyJS](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/) and I absolutely love it. It's easy, fast and well-supported by the community.

# What is Gatsby?

Gatsby is a free and open source framework based on React that helps developers build blazing fast websites and apps.

Gatsby is generally categorized as a powerful static site generator, like [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) and [Hugo](https://gohugo.io/). However, Gatsy is built on [ReactJS](https://reactjs.org/) and uses [GraphQL](https://graphql.org/) to fetch data. That allows Gatsy to work with modern features in web technologies and to build a modern website with customization.

# Prerequisite

I write this article to reach everyone who wants to build their own websites without the beforehand knowledge to build one. With that being said, if you're completely new, you might need to take a look at these crash courses so you can follow up:

- **HTML** &mdash; [freeCodeCamp's Basic HTML and HTML5 course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-html-and-html5)
- **CSS** &mdash; [freeCodeCamp's Basic CSS course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/responsive-web-design/#basic-css)
- **Javascript** &mdash; [freeCodeCamp's Basic Javascript course](https://www.freecodecamp.org/learn/javascript-algorithms-and-data-structures/#basic-javascript)
- **ReactJS** &mdash; [ReactJS tutorial](https://reactjs.org/tutorial/tutorial.html)

If you're already familiar with those fundamentals or you decide to go _yolo_, there are some few things you need to check:

- [NodeJS](https://nodejs.dev/learn) (v14.15 or newer)
- [Git](https://git-scm.com/book/en/v2/Getting-Started-Installing-Git)

# Set up

There are many ways to set up a GatsbyJS project. From minimal configuration to fully supported, everything you can find is on [Gatsby Starters](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/)

To keep it simple, I will use the official [gatsby-default-starter](https://www.gatsbyjs.com/starters/gatsbyjs/gatsby-starter-default) by the GatbyJS team to start with.
