# Component directory for MDX files

## Overview

The main focus of this component directory is to provide a way to render MDX
files as React components. This is done by using the `MDXProvider` component
from `@mdx-js/react` and passing in a `components` prop that maps the MDX
elements to React components.

Alongside with the `MDXProvider` component, this component directory also
exports a `MDXRenderer` component that can be used to render MDX files as
React components.
