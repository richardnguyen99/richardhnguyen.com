        <p>
          A Vietnamese boy who has nothing more than passion about technologies,
          computers and dreams.
        </p>
        <p>
          I love sharing my experience and my journey on programming to everyone
          because I believe there are many people who are struggling with the
          same obstacles I have before.
        </p>

        <p>
          I finished high school in my home country. I went to{" "}
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.highline.edu/" rel="noreferrer">
            @HighlineCollege
          </a>{" "}
          to obtain my Associative Degree of Computer Science. Later, I
          transferred to
          <a target="_blank" href="https://www.highline.edu/" rel="noreferrer">
            @SeattleU
          </a>
          &nbsp; and have been studying there since to finish my Bachelor Degree
          in Computer Science.

        <p>
          I tend to write down a lot when I'm struggling with something,
          especially it's about programming. So, this is my digital notebook for
          me to revisit my overcomes. By doing that, I hope it will help someone
          who has the same problem.
        </p>
        <p>
          I work with Python, Typescript, C++ and React a lot so they are my
          primary focus on this site.
